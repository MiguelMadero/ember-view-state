# Ember-view-state

Ember View State persists the values of the specified properties in a component (or controller if that's still your thing) so the state can be maintained between transitions, sessions and devices. This is useful to provide a better user experience. Some useful cases are:

* Remember the sort preferences
* Remember the last selected tab
* Remember if an accordion panel is open or closed.
